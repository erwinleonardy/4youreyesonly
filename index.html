            <h2>About Us</h2>
          	<p>The internet has become something indispensable in our lives; it is in fact the fastest growing communication medium. With the gargantuan of data we currently have in the internet, security has been put in the limelight. In order to provide secrecy in the information that we transmit, we would have to employ steganographic techniques. We do know that the existing physical signatures we use are susceptible to forgery. Hence, we propose a secure scheme to sign documents with an added layer of authentication and cryptographic security. We would make use of visual cryptography in order to achieve this. Visual cryptography is a special cryptographic technique where decryption can only be done via the human eye.</p>

      <h2 style="color:#D6EAF8">WE BELIEVE IN OUR GOAL</h2>
      <p style="color:#EAF2F8">With this project, our aim is to provide an authentication mechanism which allows users to sign documents in both a secure and seamless manner. Physical signatures introduce limitations when introduced to the digital world. Their origin is difficult to verify, i.e we do not know if the actual person has signed the document.</p>
      <p style="color:#EAF2F8">The reason why this scheme is superior to digital signature (Public Key Signature) is because there is a need to have a trusted third party in the scheme. The trusted third party may abuse the right bestowed to them by the users. In this scheme, the original document is held by the user and the shares are disseminated to the shareholders.</p>
      <p style="color:#EAF2F8">Currently in a bank, when an authorised signatory is created, they must first physically verify their signature with either a bank staff, lawyer or public notary. The bank keeps this signature for future verification purposes. When a client wants to sign a document for the bank, they will sign the original document, scan it and email it to the bank.</p>
      <p style="color:#EAF2F8">The banker will now have to physically verify the documents signature with the stored signature from the database; this is when visual cryptography kicks in. When a client wishes to sign a check, they must provide the bank with a physically signed “wet-ink” check. The banks do not allow digital checks.</p>	  
      <p style="color:#EAF2F8">With our visual cryptographic signature scheme, we aim improve the life of the clients by allowing them to use digitally signed documents and checks. The banks have a streamlined authentication process and have the added assurance that the signatures are legitimate.</p>
