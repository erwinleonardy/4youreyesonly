- Question and Answers
- Goal Alignment:
  - We created a simulation to demonstrate how visual cryptography can be effectively applied in real world applications; the simulation encompasses the process by which individuals interact with banking systems to get their cheques signed.
  - To educate people on the uses and advantages of visual cryptography, so as to raise awareness and increase its real world applications.
- Feasibility:
  - The goal of our project is primarily to showcase that visual cryptography is a viable method of encryption. We attempt to simulate the banking application accordingly, but it is not our intention to implement our application in the banking system as the banking laws in Singapore are rather strict, relative to other countries. Thus through the application, the goal is to demonstrate how visual cryptography can be utilized in industries.
- Difference from current practices in banking industry (and why Visual Cryptography):
  - One of the problems faced by the current system is fraud, as shown in slides. Visual cryptography can mitigate this problem by ensuring that the authentication is done through the shares rather than the handwritten signature. Handwritten shares open room for inconsistencies while visual cryptography provides a more systematic system
- How do you earn money with it :
  - As our current product is a simulation, it will be available at no cost. Once the implementation is full fledge, we will introduce a tier pricing scheme to suit the customers needs
