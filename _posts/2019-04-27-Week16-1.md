##### 1) Agenda item:  Discuss project with supervisor
- Product is (suppose) to enhance the existing banking system instead of redefining the CTS?
- Write down flow of Banking/CTS system and see where our product fits in
- Supervisor discourages continuation of product due to lack of feasibility. 
- Current options including alternatives:
  - Convert product into an educational tool
  - Convert product into signing of legal documents in organisations
  - Continue with current idea and provide strong justification
- After evaluation of our choices, we decided on implementing an education tool on top of our current idea and eliminated legal documents as in organisations signing of legal documents is usually done with hard copy.


##### Next Meeting Agenda
- Incorporate Learning Tool into our Application
