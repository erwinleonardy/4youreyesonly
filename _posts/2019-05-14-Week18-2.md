##### 1) Agenda item: Finalizing Product Details
- Group discussed if product is a signing application/learning tool/proof of concept/raise awareness
  - Our application serves to justify that visual cryptography can be utilized as a remote authentication tool when it comes to signing documents and cheques and this idea is clearly expressed through the flow of the application. It is shown how a bank customer can sign a cheque and how it can be visually verified by the party receiving it, in our case the bank. All the additional features being implemented are provided to make the implementation more rich and comprehensive.
  - Benefits:
     - Visual cryptography allows authentication for the user
- Based of supervisor feedback, team to create a real life scenario to represent the flow of product.
- Erwin asked if learning tool needs to improve, team determined that it was complete and due to time constraints it  needs no further action
- Finalize and write application flow, inclusive of features:
  - [Bank accounts already exist for use]
  1. Client Registers Account
     - Client can login, but is not associated with any bank accounts, thus unable to sign any cheques
  2. Client goes to Bank Branch to be associated with Bank’s account
     - Client can login and is associated with bank’s account, client can repeat step 2 with any Bank that has accounts on our application
  3. Client Signs a Cheque
     - Client can sign as many cheques as they wish, with any bank they are associated with
  4. Bank verifies cheque submitted
     - If there are no cheques to be verified, feedback will be displayed to bank account, otherwise a list of cheques to be verified will be shown
