##### 1) Agenda item: Finalise business application
- Banking application (✔️)
  - Tack-on security
- Secret document
  - Security: n shares with k keys
  - Watermarking: hide information in pixels (stenography)
    - When regenerated, if bits @ watermark are accurate visual cryptography is applied
  - Server keeps the majority shares to decrypt, requires correct share from user to decrypt, so without the servers shares its not possible to delete
  - Revoke users shares based on timestamps if necessary
- Selling Points
  - Revocability of shares (ensures that document is not available for access after certain time frame and prevents future attacks)
  - Watermark (makes use of steganography) provides authentication to the document by not revealing the correct watermark in the document.
  - K keys overlaps responsibility such that no less than k individuals have access to the document
- Ideal selling point (need to check plausibility)
  - Cannot be deciphered if:
    - Server compromised (Shares held by server insufficient)
    - User compromised (Shares held by user insufficient)
