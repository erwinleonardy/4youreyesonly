##### 1) Agenda item: Discuss document sharing idea with supervisor
- Context: refine application to make it less intrusive to users, has to be more user friendly (having all parties present might be a nuisance)
  - Usually you only need 2 parties involved
  - Dependant on the severity of the application, the number of shares necessary is increased (e.g. inc amt in bank)
  - Contextualize the scenario as a real life scenario
    - Secret recipe scenario: coke has 7 people who knows part of secret. Everyone has to be present to make coke (part of secret is share)
  - Application should be generic, but it has to be described such that it can be applied in real life
  - Application should not compromise security
    - Confidential files should be kept at client side and not sent to our servers
    - Application as a web service is more effective as its a more modern approach
    - Sufficient mechanisms must be put into place to provide security such that no unauthorized parties can be involved in the decryption, including our application itself
- Person who owns the document, can share authorization permissions with other parties to share with other users.

##### 2) Agenda item: Prototype
- Accessor want to see if you know what you want to do
- Menu Screen (look and feel)
  - Functionality screens
  - Functionality does not need to be present
  - How the application is presented to user
